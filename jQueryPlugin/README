learned how to create simple jquery plugins

notes for myself:

-Always wrap your plugin in (function( $ ){ // plugin goes here })( jQuery );

-Don't redundantly wrap the this keyword in the immediate scope of your plugin's function

-Unless you're returning an intrinsic value from your plugin,
 always have your plugin's function return the this keyword to maintain chainability.

-Rather than requiring a lengthy amount of arguments,
 pass your plugin settings in an object literal that can be extended over the plugin's defaults.

-Don't clutter the jQuery.fn object with more than one namespace per plugin.

-Always namespace your methods, events and data.

-jQuery.fn is pronounced jQuery effin'
